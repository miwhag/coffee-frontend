# Coffee App 

This was a one week, Mod 2, fullstack project. We made this for a singular coffee shop, one who deals with providing a number of roasters at their shop. Our intention was to create a system for ordering and tracking inventory. Feel free to take a look around --

## How the app works  

* To run the app, first clone down the repo to your local device. 
* `lite-server` into your terminal. This will prompt the application to start, however you will also need the backend repo to see the data: https://github.com/Paradafaii28/Mod-2-project-coffee-backend- 

* From there you can navigate through the website seen in the video above 

* Click the Admin Sign-in link to see the full list of the items in our inventory. On this page you can also:
    * Add a new coffee roaster 
    * Add a new blend to the inventory with the coffee roaster you added 
    * Track items you have in your inventory 
    * Delete function(in works)

* The View Coffee Page will show you all of the coffees that we have in our inventory. It matches the data on the inventory page, only this allows you to visually see what we have in our database, as well as show information about individual coffees. You can also click the link of any coffee on the page and will be given the option to add it to your cart.

* Finally our Cart shows all of the items currently stored in our Cart model. You can delete it from the cart by clicking delete. 


## Things to add / Down the pipeline

* Delete items from the inventory list 
* Finish checkout cart, including adding sum of all items in the cart 
* Once you checkout and items have been "purchased", reflect the change in the inventory list 
* Create seperate sign in flows for owners and shop customers
